        <h2>Why BTS?</h2>
        <h3>Why BTS is the best:</h3>
        <p>
          BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language
          studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The
          group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to
          sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into
          the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United
          States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold
          certification from the Recording Industry Association of America
          (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from
          South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love
          Yourself: Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since
          the Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less
          than two years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first
          Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they
          also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both
          the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their
          Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage Love",
          "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made them the
          fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake
          in 2006.

          Beyond their breathtaking performances and visuals, the group has
          successfully cultivated a worldwide community of fans that have come
          to embrace their message of positivity and acceptance. Despite much of
          their content being in Korean, BTS has created an avenue to look past
          the language barrier, eliminating any biases of what people deem good
          music is and what it should be, forming a deeper connection with
          anyone who is willing to listen. At the end of the day, it doesn’t
          matter who you are–there are seven boys in South Korea named Namjoon,
          Seokjin, Yoongi, Hoseok, Jimin, Taehyung, and Jungkook who are here
          and who understand you.
