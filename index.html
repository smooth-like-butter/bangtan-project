            <h2>Why BTS?</h2>
            <h3>Why BTS is the best:</h3>
            <p>
              BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. BTS released
              their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark &
              Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean
              studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million
              copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global
              music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States,
              becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification
              from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for
              their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea
              to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself:
              Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since the
              Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years,
              with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album
              certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became
              the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the
              Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their
              Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage
              Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made
              them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since
              Justin Timberlake in 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond their breathtaking performances and visuals, the group has
              successfully cultivated a worldwide community of fans that have
              come to embrace their message of positivity and acceptance.
              Despite much of their content being in Korean, BTS has created an
              avenue to look past the language barrier, eliminating any biases
              of what people deem good music is and what it should be, forming a
              deeper connection with anyone who is willing to listen. At the end
              of the day, it doesn’t matter who you are–there are seven boys in
              South Korea named Namjoon, Seokjin, Yoongi, Hoseok, Jimin,
              Taehyung, and Jungkook who are here and who understand you.

                <h4>IDOL</h4>
                <p>
                  “IDOL” explores the concept of identity and being an idol for
                  yourself, rather than anyone else. After the track's release,
                  it inspired an internet dance challenge called the “Idol
                  Challenge”, showing fans dancing along to the chorus of the
                  song to the song's choreography.

                  They point fingers at me, but I don't care at all Whatever the
                  reason for your criticism is I know what I am (I know what I
                  am) I know what I want (I know what I want) I never gon'
                  change (I never gon' change) I never gon' trade (Trade off)

                <h4>Black Swan</h4>
                <p>
                  This R&B track recalls the pain of growing distant from one’s
                  passions, in this case dancing. Throughout the song, there
                  never seems to be a true climax, the vocals always distant yet
                  there nonetheless. Fitting for the title of the song, a black
                  swan is an event that happens unexpectedly, has extreme
                  impact, and is something of human nature.

                  Heartbeat pulsing slow in my ears Bump, bump, bump Trying to
                  escape with no avail Jump, jump, jump No song affects me
                  anymore Crying out a silent cry
                </p>

                <h4>Mikrokosmos</h4>
                <p>
                  The title Mikrokosmos references the ancient Greek philosophy
                  of microcosm, the perception of viewing humans as their own
                  little world or mikros kosmos. In a broader sense, microcosm
                  studies the harmonious relationship of each individual in
                  parallel to everything else, which continues BTS' narrative of
                  self discovery and persona.

                  You got me I dream while looking at you I got you Inside those
                  pitch black nights The lights we saw in each other Were saying
                  the same thing
